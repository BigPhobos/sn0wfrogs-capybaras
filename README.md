## Features
### Capybaras:
- A new mob found in both normal and mangroove swamps. This mob will spawn anywhere on those, but will spawn way more frequently at Capybara's Paradise, found in mangroove swamps.
- Capybaras will follow you if you hold a melon slice or a mandarin. These items also allow you to breed them.
- Capybaras are semi-aquatic animals, they will always try to stay close to a water body, and if near a thermal spring, they will prefer that. However, they do not need water in order to survive.
- [ADD MORE FEATURES FOR CAPYBARAS]
### Capybara's Paradise:
- A new structure found in mangroove swamps. Here, capybaras spawn more often than in the rest of the swamp.
- You'll find lots of watermelons scattered around, as well as small ponds with thermal springs.
- [ADD MORE FEATURES FOR CAPYBARA'S PARADISE]
### Mandarins:
- Mandarin trees: 
  - A new tree type. This tree's log has a white-ish outer shell, while being a soft orange on the inside. Much like Oak trees, these trees' leaves have a chance at dropping mandarins.
- Mandarin:
  - A new food type. Eating this will gives 1.5 hunger points + the "Sweetened" effect for 5 seconds.
  - You can use mandarins to attract capybaras, breed them, and if right-clicked while shifting, you can put it on their heads.
- Mandarin wood:
  - A new wood type. Has a slight orange tint to it. Works as any other type of wood.
### Thermal springs:
- A new block. Thermal springs are capybaras' hotspots (no pun intended), as they are attracted to it.
- This block emits steam particles from the water block above it and above the water blocks connected to those. If not covered by water, it emits high speed water and steam particles.
- Stepping on this block when not covered in water will burn you, much like magma blocks do.
### Sweetened:
- A new effect. While having this effect, all food gives you 50% more hunger points (1.5x). For golden apples and enchanted golden apples, you'll get 50% more hearts.
- This effect is only obtainable through eating mandarins.
