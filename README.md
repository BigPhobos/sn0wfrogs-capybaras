## Features
### Capybaras:
- Capybaras are new mods found in mangrove swamps and swamps. They will spawn anywhere on those, but will spawn way more frequently at Capybara's Paradise, also found in mangrove swamps.
- Capybaras will follow you if you hold a melon slice. It also allows you to breed them.
- Capybaras are semi-aquatic animals, so they spawn more often near water bodies. However, they do not need water in order to survive.
### Capybara's Paradise:
- A new structure found in mangroove swamps. Here, capybaras spawn more often than in the rest of the swamp, and they'll also stay closer to these structures.
- You'll find lots of watermelons scattered around, as well as small ponds with thermal springs, currently being the only way to obtain this new block.
### Mandarins:
- Mandarin bushes:
  - Despite being totally not realistic, mandarin bushes are the way to get the new fruit.
  - You can find mandarins, mandarin leaves and flowering mandarin leaves in these bushes. Breaking the leaves has a chance at dropping mandarins, much like apples drop from oak leaves.
- Mandarin:
  - A new food type. Eating this will gives 2 hunger points + the "Sweetened" effect for 5 seconds.
  - You can put a mandarin on a capybara's head by right clicking them while holding it.
### Thermal springs:
- A new decorative block. Thermal springs are capybaras' hotspots (no pun intended), as they are attracted to it.
- This block emits steam particles from the every water block in a 5 block radius. If there's water below it, it will essentially become a geyser.
### Sweetened:
- A new effect. While having this effect, all food gives you 50% more hunger points (1.5x). For golden apples and enchanted golden apples, you'll get 50% more hearts.
- This effect is only obtainable through eating mandarins.

## FAQ

**Can I include this mod in a modpack?**

**Yes**: You can, no need for approval. However, I would love to know what modpacks are using this mod, so don't hesitate to message me on discord! (iuriineves).

**I found a bug! What do I do?**

**Open an issue**: Just make an issue on this mod's github page and I'll try to fix is as soon as I can. Make sure to explain how to reproduce the bug as well.

**Can you port this mod to X modloader?**

**No**: I only mod for the Fabric loader, so other modloader versions are not going to happen. Sorry! (A quilt version might happen, though)
